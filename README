This is my final project for my operating systems' course in which I added ticketlock to my program and implemented reader/writer problem with reader's priority over writers.
That is, whenever there's atleast a reader in the system, other reader's are allowed to come and writers must wait. No two wirters are allowed at the same time.
I have also written a report which I have uploeaded.
